# German Human Genome-Phenome Archive (GHGA) Website

## Developers & Testers

The site uses Jekyll. To test the website locally, follow the instructions in the Github <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll" target="_blank">Help</a>.

Essentially, you need an installation of Jekyll. If you use Bundler you can start the website locally with

```bash
cd ghga-de_online    # or however you called the repository dir
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then point your browser to the local address displayed in the output of the command. That's it!
