                      The German Human Genome-Phenome Archive (GHGA), which will be federated with the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA), and which is designed to archive and facilitate analysis of human access controlled research data from Germany, has gone live with a pilot version, distributing research data from Heidelberg and TÃ¼bingen. We look forward to its use by human biology, genetics and disease research communities.
